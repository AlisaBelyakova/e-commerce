Run steps: 
`npm install` to install all the dependencies 
`npm run seed` if you want to seed local database with some samples
`npm run start-dev` find the app on localhost:8080

If you want to run the server and/or webpack separately, you can also `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.
